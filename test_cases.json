        "query": "What is machine learning?",
        "expected": "Machine learning is a field within AI that develops algorithms and models enabling computers to learn and make decisions without explicit programming. It allows machines to analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions with minimal human intervention by training on vast datasets. ML is categorized into three types: Supervised Learning, where algorithms learn from labeled data to make predictions; Unsupervised Learning, where algorithms find patterns in unlabeled data for clustering and anomaly detection; and Reinforcement Learning, where models learn through rewards and penalties to optimize decision-making. Applications include image and speech recognition, NLP, recommendation systems, fraud detection, predictive analytics, and autonomous driving, making ML a key part of modern AI systems.",
        "generated": "Based on the provided knowledge, machine learning (ML) is the practice of applying computer algorithms and statistics to create models that can learn from past data and then make decisions or predictions about future data. It is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables algorithms to learn from data without explicit instructions from programmers. ML algorithms learn how to make decisions without needing anyone to program all the specific rules."

        "query": "What is logistic regression?",
        "expected": "Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict binary outcomes, such as the probability of an event occurring or a category that a data point belongs to. It employs a sigmoid function to convert continuous data into a probability, enabling predictions about binary events or classifications.",
        "generated": "Based on the provided knowledge, **logistic regression** is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes from data. It uses a **sigmoid function** (also known as a squashing function) to convert continuous data into a percentage probability of a binary outcome, such as the probability of being a \u201cgood credit\u201d borrower.\n\nRegarding your question, **\"What is regression?\"**, the provided knowledge does not define regression in general. It only explains logistic regression specifically. Therefore, I don't know the answer to that broader question."

        "query": "What is a neural network?",
        "expected": "A neural network is an advanced machine learning model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected artificial neurons organized into input, hidden, and output layers. These networks excel at processing complex, large-scale datasets and are widely used by companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon for various applications. They learn by adjusting connection weights and biases through backpropagation, an iterative process that minimizes prediction errors, enhancing their accuracy and performance over time.",
        "generated": "A neural network is an advanced form of machine learning that contains multiple layers of nodes which perform individual computations. It is a powerful technique modeled after neurons in the human brain, designed to mimic the way our brains function, with artificial neurons serving the same purpose as biological neurons. A modern neural network model is a structure composed of several connected perceptrons that learn from input data to produce an output. Industry leaders such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Amazon use neural networks for analyzing complex datasets."
